KeYmaera X
==========

KeYmaera X is a theorem prover for differential dynamic logic (dL), a logic for specifying and verifying properties of hybrid systems with mixed discrete and continuous dynamics. Reasoning about complicated hybrid systems models requires support for sophisticated proof techniques, efficient computation, and a user interface that crystallizes salient properties of the system. KeYmaera X allows users to specify custom proof search techniques as tactics, execute these tactics in parallel, and interface with partial proofs via an extensible user interface.

Advanced proof search features---and user-defined tactics in particular---are difficult to check for soundness. To admit extension and experimentation in proof search without reducing trust in the prover, KeYmaera X is built up from a small trusted kernel. The prover kernel contains a list of sound dL axioms that are instantiated using a uniform substitution proof rule. Isolating all soundness-critical reasoning to this prover kernel obviates the intractable task of ensuring that each new proof search algorithm is implemented correctly. Experiments suggest that a single layer of tactics on top of the prover kernel provides a rich language for implementing novel and sophisticated proof search techniques.

Installation
============
The easiest way to run KeYmaera X is to download binaries 
[keymaerax.jar](http://keymaerax.org/keymaerax.jar) and run it via

    java -jar keymaerax.jar

Ensure that the following software is installed
- [Java Development Kit JDK](https://java.com/download)
  (version 1.8+ recommended. Mathematica 9.0 is only compatible with Java 1.6 and 1.7. Mathematica 10.0+ are also compatible with Java 1.8)
- [Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/)
  (version 10+ recommended. Other versions may work.
  The Mathematica J/Link library that comes with Mathematica is needed during compilation. Mathematica needs to be activated to use it also at runtime.
  Otherwise [https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3](Z3) is automatically used for arithmetic.)

##### FAQ: Run Problems
=================

If running `java -jar keymaerax.jar` results in the error `Invalid or corrupt jarfile` then update to Java 1.8 (and to Mathematic 10+)
or run KeYmaera X via

    java -Xss20M -cp keymaerax.jar KeYmaeraX

If KeYmaera X acts weird after an update, you should clean your local cache of lemmas by removing (or renaming) the directory `~/.keymaerax/cache`.
You could also try removing or renaming the model and proof database `~/.keymaerax/keymaerax.sqlite` (if this file has become corrupt, it may prevent KeYmaera X from working properly).

Errors related to JLinkNative Library are caused by incompatibilities of Java 1.8 in combination with Mathematica 9. It is recommended to use Mathematica 10.

Command Line Execution and Templates
====================================
For batch operation, KeYmaera X accepts models and tactics from the command line. Templates and example models can be
 found in

    keymaerax-webui/src/main/resources/cmdlinetemplates

This directory provides templates for models, tactics, and scripts for running KeYmaera X from the command line. It
further provides the example model from the KeYmaera X cheat sheet (CheatSheet.kyx), as well as tactics for proving
the cheat sheet model.

##### Configuration
KeYmaera X requires a decision procedure for real arithmetic to finalize proofs. It is tested best with Mathematica.
Depending on the operating system, Mathematica is installed in different locations. Adapt prove.sh to specify the
parameters -mathkernel and -jlink according to the local Mathematica setup. Parameters that are appropriate when
Mathematica is installed in the default location are provided below.

Specification
=============

The goal of KeYmaera X is to implement the proof calculus of differential dynamic logic in a way that is amenable to soundness assurance by way of a small trusted LCF-style kernel while still being amenable to automatic theorem proving.
Differential dynamic logic and its Hilbert-type and sequent proof calculi have been described and specified in more detail in:
