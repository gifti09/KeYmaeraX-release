KeYmaera X
==========

Self-driving cars, autonomous robots, modern airplanes, or robotic surgery: we increasingly entrust our lives to computers and therefore should strive for nothing but the highest safety standards - mathematical correctness proof. Proofs for such cyber-physical systems can be constructed with the KeYmaera X prover. As a hybrid systems theorem prover, KeYmaera X analyzes the control program and the physical behavior of the controlled system together in differential dynamic logic.

KeYmaera X features a minimal core of just 1700 lines of code that isolates all soundness-critical reasoning. Such a small and simple prover core makes it much easier to trust verification results. Pre-defined and custom tactics built on top of the core drive automated proof search. KeYmaera X comes with a web-based front-end that provides a clean interface for both interactive and automated proving, highlighting the most crucial parts of a verification activity.

Installation
============
The easiest way to run KeYmaera X is to download binaries 
[keymaerax.jar](http://keymaerax.org/keymaerax.jar) and start from command line

    java -jar keymaerax.jar

First ensure that the following software is installed
- [Java Development Kit JDK](https://java.com/download)
  (version 1.8+ recommended. Mathematica 9.0 is only compatible with Java 1.6 and 1.7. Mathematica 10.0+ are also compatible with Java 1.8)
- [Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/)
  (version 10+ recommended. Other versions may work.
  The Mathematica J/Link library that comes with Mathematica is needed during compilation. Mathematica needs to be activated to use it also at runtime.
  Otherwise the [Z3 Solver](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) is automatically used for real arithmetic.)

#### FAQ: Run Problems

If running `java -jar keymaerax.jar` results in the error `Invalid or corrupt jarfile` then update to Java 1.8 and to Mathematica 10+.
If you need to use an earlier version of Java or Mathematica, you can also run KeYmaera X via

    java -Xss20M -cp keymaerax.jar KeYmaeraX

If KeYmaera X acts weird after an update, clean your local cache of lemmas by removing (or renaming) the directory `~/.keymaerax/cache`.
You could also try renaming the model and proof database `~/.keymaerax/keymaerax.sqlite` (if this file has become corrupt, it may prevent KeYmaera X from working properly).

Errors related to `com.wolfram.jlink` or `JLinkNativeLibrary` are caused by incompatibilities of Java 1.8 in combination with Mathematica 9. It is recommended to use Mathematica 10. Or they may be caused by some operating system configuration issues.

#### Configuration
KeYmaera X requires a decision procedure for real arithmetic to finalize proofs. It is tested best with Mathematica.
After starting KeYmaera X you can configure arithmetic tools in the _Help->Tool Configuration_ menu.

Depending on the operating system, Mathematica is installed in different locations. 
Alternatively, you can also specify which arithmetic tools to use from command line with
parameters `-mathkernel` and `-jlink`. Parameters that are appropriate when
Mathematica is installed in the default location are provided below.

#### Default Configuration Parameters per Operating System
Mac OS, 64bit, Mathematica 10.4+
* `-mathkernel /Applications/Mathematica.app/Contents/MacOS/MathKernel`
* `-jlink /Applications/Mathematica.app/Contents/SystemFiles/Links/JLink/SystemFiles/Libraries/MacOSX-x86-64`

Linux, 64bit, Mathematica 10.4+
* `-mathkernel /usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/10.4/Executables/MathKernel`
* `-jlink /usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/10.4/SystemFiles/Links/JLink/SystemFiles/Libraries/Linux-x86-64`

Windows, 64bit, Mathematica 10.4+
* `-mathkernel "C:\Program Files\Wolfram Research\Mathematica\10.4\MathKernel.exe"`
* `-jlink "C:\Program Files\Wolfram Research\Mathematica\10.4\SystemFiles\Links\JLink\SystemFiles\Libraries\Windows-x86-64"`

Specification
=============

KeYmaera X implements the uniform substitution calculus for differential dynamic logic in order to enable soundness assurance by way of a small trusted LCF-style kernel while still being amenable to automatic theorem proving.

The soundness assurances provided by a small LCF-style kernel are further strengthened by a cross-verification of the soundness theorem for the uniform substitution calculus in [Isabelle/HOL](https://github.com/LS-Lab/Isabelle-dL) and [Coq](https://github.com/LS-Lab/Coq-dL).

A secondary goal of KeYmaera X is to also make it possible to implement extensions of differential dynamic logic, such as differential game logic for hybrid games as well as quantified differential dynamic logic for distributed hybrid systems:
