KeYmaera X
==========

KeYmaera X is a theorem prover for differential dynamic logic (dL), a logic for specifying and verifying properties of hybrid systems with mixed discrete and continuous dynamics. Reasoning about complicated hybrid systems models requires support for sophisticated proof techniques, efficient computation, and a user interface that crystallizes salient properties of the system. KeYmaera X allows users to specify custom proof search techniques as tactics, execute these tactics in parallel, and interface with partial proofs via an extensible user interface.

Advanced proof search features---and user-defined tactics in particular---are difficult to check for soundness. To admit extension and experimentation in proof search without reducing trust in the prover, KeYmaera X is built up from a small trusted kernel. The prover kernel contains a list of sound dL axioms that are instantiated using a uniform substitution proof rule. Isolating all soundness-critical reasoning to this prover kernel obviates the intractable task of ensuring that each new proof search algorithm is implemented correctly. Experiments suggest that a single layer of tactics on top of the prover kernel provides a rich language for implementing novel and sophisticated proof search techniques.

Branches
========

- `master` is the branch for active ongoing developments of KeYmaera X.
- [The Repository's Releases Page](https://github.com/LS-Lab/KeYmaeraX-release/releases) lists all tagged stable releases.

Dependencies
============
- [Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/)
  (version 10+ recommended. Other versions may work. The Mathematica J/Link library that comes with Mathematica is needed during compilation. Mathematica needs to be activated to use it also at runtime.)
- [Java Development Kit JDK](https://java.com/download)
  (version 1.8+ recommended. Mathematica 9.0 is only compatible with Java 1.6 and 1.7. Mathematica 10.0 is also compatible with Java 1.8)
- [Scala Build Tool sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org)
  (Version 0.13 or greater recommended. Other versions may work). If you are using IntelliJ, this comes with the Scala plugin.
- [Scala 2.11.7](http://www.scala-lang.org)
  (sbt will download this automatically)

Installation
============

The easiest way to run KeYmaera X is to download the `keymaerax.jar` binary file from

  http://keymaeraX.org/

and run it via

    java -jar keymaerax.jar

If this results in the error `Invalid or corrupt jarfile` then update to Java 1.8 or run it via

    java -Xss20M -cp keymaerax.jar KeYmaeraX

The easiest way to run KeYmaera X from source is to install its dependencies and build it via Scala Build Tool sbt:

    * Install the dependencies (see Dependencies section)
    * Point the JLINK_JAR_LOCATION environment variable to Mathematic's JLink.jar file (see FAQ)
    * Follow the build instructions in the Building section

Building
========

KeYmaera X uses the Scala Build Tool (sbt). Installation instructions are available
at the link following:

http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html

Detailed instructions are available at that website as well. Briefly, type

    sbt compile

to compile the source code. First-time compilation may take a while, since it downloads all necessary libraries, including Scala itself. 

After compilation (re-)initialize the lemma database by first deleting the KeYmaera X cache in your home directory, and then run the test suite initializing the lemma database as follows.

    rm -rf ~/.keymaerax/cache
    sbt "test-only edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.btactics.DerivedAxiomsTests"

To run the regression test case suite, type, for example,

    sbt test -l edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.tags.IgnoreInBuildTest

##### FAQ: Build Problems
===================
The build file uses default paths to the Mathematica JLink JAR for MacOS and Mathematica 10 (see default.properties).
If those are not suitable for your setup, create a file 'local.properties' in the same directory as default.properties
(project root) and provide the location of JLink.jar with a property mathematica.jlink.path=YOUR_LOCAL_PATH_TO_JLINKJAR

If, at any time, you run into problems during the compilation process, use `sbt clean` for a fresh start to remove stale files. If the problems persist, use `sbt clean` followed by `sbt reload`. On a few computers you may have to edit your environment variables, e.g., `~/.bashrc` or  `~/.profile` to include something like

    export SBT_OPTS="-Xss20M -Xms8000M"

The Wiki contains extended build instructions and solutions to other
common sbt problems:

https://github.com/LS-Lab/KeYmaera4/wiki/Building-Instructions

##### FAQ: Run Problems
=================

If KeYmaera X acts weird after an update, you should clean your local cache of lemmas by removing (or renaming) the directory `~/.keymaerax/cache` or even the whole `~/.keymaerax/` directory.
You could also try removing or renaming the model and proof database `~/.keymaerax/keymaerax.sqlite` (if this file has become corrupt, it may prevent KeYmaera X from working properly).


Generating API Documentation
============================

KeYmaera X API Documentation is generated via Scaladoc and available at:
  
   http://keymaeraX.org/scaladoc

To generate unified scaladoc for all subprojects locally, run:

    sbt unidoc

Documentation will be generated for the whole project in the `target/scala-x.xx/unidoc` directory.
For instance `target/scala-2.11/unidoc`.

To generate just the core KeYmaera X API documentation files locally, run:

    sbt doc

Documentation will be generated for each subproject in the 
`target/scala-x.xx/api` directory of the subproject. 
For instance, `keymaerax-core/target/scala-2.11/api` for the core subproject.

Main documentation to read for KeYmaera X API:

    http://keymaeraX.org/doc/dL-grammar.md - concrete syntax for input language Differential Dynamic Logic
    edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.core.package   - KeYmaera X kernel, proof certificates, main data structures
    edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.parser.package - Parser and pretty printer with concrete syntax and notation
    edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.btactics.package - Tactic library
    edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.btactics.TactixLibrary - Main tactic library for most common cases
    edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.launcher.KeYmaeraX - command-line launcher for KeYmaera X

IntelliJ IDEA Development Environment
=====================================

If you choose to use the IntelliJ IDEA development environment, install it:
- Install IntelliJ IDEA
- Install the Scala plugin for IntelliJ (the IntelliJ installer will ask you if you want to do this)

Project Setup
- Make sure you have defined the JLINK_JAR_LOCATION environment variable (see FAQ).
- Create a new Scala project, backed by SBT
- Select a JDK as your project SDK, add a new one if not previously added
- Check `update automatically` (not checked by default), so that updates to build.sbt are reflected automatically in the project. You may also want to check the "Download and compile sources" options.
- If the bundled version of sbt is not working for you, you can specify your own version here.

Create a new run configuration of type Application for the KeYmaera X Web UI.
- Main class: `edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.hydra.NonSSLBoot`
- Set the working directory to the project path
- Use the classpath of your project module
- Check "Single instance only"
- Make sure the JVM option `-Xss20M` is included in the run configuration.

Test Cases:
- Right click on project folder `keymaerax-webui/src/test` to mark this directory as Test Sources Root.
- Make sure the JVM option `-Xss20M` is included in the run configuration.
- Right click on the test folder to run all its ScalaTests.

Tagged Test Suite:
Run Configurations Drop-down in Toolbar
 -> Edit Configurations
 -> Add Configuration (ScalaTest)
 -> Select "All in package" for Test Kind
 -> Under "Test options" enter:
      `-n edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.tags.CheckinTest -n edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.tags.SummaryTest -l edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.tags.ObsoleteTest`
      (or any other string from `TestTags.scala`)
 -> Select "keymaerax" as SDK and classpath of module
 -> Apply/OK

##### IntelliJ FAQ
============
If, at any time, you run into problems during the compilation process in IntelliJ, check the `File->Project Structure->Modules->core->Dependencies` to make sure the appropriate files such as `SBT: unmanaged-jars` are checked. This is necessary for IntelliJ to find JLink.jar. IntelliJ keeps forgetting about it, so you may have to check repeatedly. If the problems persist, do `File->Invalidate Caches / Restart`.

Front End
=========

The Web UI web user interface front end of KeYmaera X can be started as follows:

    sbt assembly
    java -jar keymaerax-webui/target/scala-2.11/keymaerax-web.jar
    open http://localhost:8090/

The first command builds a .JAR, and the second command runs the built .jar. If the jar won't start because of an error `no manifest found` you may have to run `sbt clean` first.
In case of errors about `invalid or corrupt jarfile`, please update Java to a newer version.

For development purposes, the Web UI can be run from an IDE by selecting as the Main class if you pass its JVM the option `-Xss20M`:

    keymaerax-webui/src/main/scala/edu/cmu/cs/ls/keymaerax/hydra/NoSSLBoot.scala

Note that using the launcher/Main class won't work in IntelliJ but NoSSLBoot.scala must be used instead.

Errors related to JLinkNative Library are caused by incompatibilities of Java 1.8 in combination with Mathematica 9.
It is recommended to use Mathematica 10.

KeYmaera X is successfully started when you see the following console output

    Bound to 127.0.0.1:8090

To find out how to use KeYmaera X from command line, do `sbt clean assembly` and run

    java -Xss20M -jar keymaerax-webui/target/scala-2.11/keymaerax-web.jar -help

Make sure you have Java 1.8 for using the command line like this. Java 1.7 and earlier versions may limit functionality.

Command Line Execution and Templates
====================================
For batch operation, KeYmaera X accepts models and tactics from the command line. Templates and example models can be
 found in

    keymaerax-webui/src/main/resources/cmdlinetemplates

This directory provides templates for models, tactics, and scripts for running KeYmaera X from the command line. It
further provides the example model from the KeYmaera X cheat sheet (CheatSheet.kyx), as well as tactics for proving
the cheat sheet model.

Source Code Layout
==================

KeYmaera X API Documentation explains the package layout: http://keymaeraX.org/scaladoc

`build.sbt` - SBT configuration file.

The project is split into two subprojects, `keymaerax-core` for the core functionalities of the prover and `keymaerax-webui` for everything else.

    keymaerax-core/src/ - Source code directory
    keymaerax-core/src/main/scala - source code (edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax)
    keymaerax-webui/src/ - Source code directory for Web UI etc.
    keymaerax-webui/src/test/scala - tests run by `sbt test`
    keymaerax-core/target/scala-2.11/api/ - Target directory for sbt doc documentation.
    target/ - Generated files directory created by sbt on first compilation.
    target/scala-2.11/classes/ - Target directory for sbt compilation.    
    target/scala-2.11/unidoc/ - Target directory for sbt unidoc documentation.    

Within the `edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax` namespace, source code is separated according to functionality:

    .core        - KeYmaera X Kernel: Soundness-critical core
    .lemma       - Lemma mechanism (non-critical)
    .bellerophon - Tactic language, framework and tactic interpreter
    .btactics    - Tactic library
    .parser      - Parsing and pretty printing
    .pt          - Proof checker for proof terms
    .tactics     - Older scheduled tactic framework, including tactic implementations and the scheduler
    .tools       - Arithmetic back-ends

The additional packages in the directory `keymaerax-webui/src/main/scala` are separated into:

    .api     - Scala API for proof and tactics management etc.
    .codegen - Code generation tools to generate C-Code etc.
    .hydra   - HyDRA Hybrid Distributed Reasoning Architecture server with REST API and database
    .launcher - KeYmaera X command line launcher with main program
    .tacticsinterface - Interface to the actics exposed to the web UI and REST API. Tactic combinator parser.

Test Cases
==========

The full test suite can be run from command line, e.g., by

    sbt test -l edu.cmu.cs.ls.keymaerax.tags.IgnoreInBuildTest 

Selectively running individual test cases within the sbt interactive mode:

    sbt
    sbt>  test-only *USubst*

Or, run on a more fine-grained level within a class use
object MyTest extends Tag("MyTest")

    object MyTest extends Tag("MyTest")
    it should "do something useful" taggedAs(MyTest) in {....}
    it should "do anything useful" taggedAs(MyTest) in {....}
    it should "do more good" taggedAs(MoreTest) in {....}

Then in sbt interactive mode run   

    sbt>  test-only -- -n "MyTest MoreTest"

To inline scala console output alongside the test suite information, first do:

    sbt>  set logBuffered in Test := false

IntelliJ IDEA can also run the test suite (see #IntelliJ IDEA).

Specification
=============

The goal of KeYmaera X is to implement the proof calculus of differential dynamic logic in a way that is amenable to soundness assurance by way of a small trusted LCF-style core while still being amenable to automatic theorem proving.
Differential dynamic logic and its Hilbert-type and sequent proof calculi have been described and specified in more detail in:
